[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.36[/B][/COLOR]
- Fixed some areas in code where new module names were not changed over. Hopefully caught them all.
- Other fixes.
- Code one time appearing notice of new add-on Fen. It should only show once to let any users know that future development will happen on Fen instead of Furk It. I don't like this type of code, but there isn't really another way if someone doesn't read the changelog.
- Probably the final release of Furk It. Please move to new Fen add-on (renamed Furk It) for future support and development.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.35[/B][/COLOR]
- Changed dependencies and code for renamed modules:
* script.furkit.artwork ---> script.tiki.artwork (Tiki Artwork)
* script.module.furkitmeta ---> script.module.tikimeta (Tiki Meta)
* script.module.furkitscrapers ---> script.module.tikiscrapers (Tiki Scrapers)

- Changes to external sources filtering and label making to hopefully make displaying results faster.
- NOTE: If you are using Furkit Scrapers, and results will not show after scraping, disable 'WSUNBLOCK' in furkitscrapers' settings. The problem with this scraper is hopefully fixed with this Furk It update, though.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.30[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.28[/B][/COLOR]

- Added 'Remove Duplicate Links' to External Scraper settings. Will slow down showing of search results (shouldn't be too bad on faster devices). [Code is by doko-desuka].
- Some cleaning of code.
- Stopped adding latest changes to addon.xml changelog (news).


[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.27[/B][/COLOR]
- Fix Trakt Watchlist items not showing in Next Episodes when set to do so.
- Did some code changes to playback and sources in preparation for more changes. Playback and Downloading may be affected. I have tested the changes but there are always problems I don't see myself. Roll back to 1.2.26 if facing issues.
- Other code cleanup.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.26[/B][/COLOR]
- 'Dialog' results display now shows simple results pop-up, instead of extra info like poster etc to speed up the showing of results when 'Dialog' chosen.
- New setting in General/Navigation to enable/disable Kodi's built-in 'cacheToDisc' function. (Enabled by default)
- [B]###INFO FOR cacheToDisc...:###[/B]
    - cacheToDisc is a Kodi setting that makes Kodi cache the directory you are viewing. If you then hit 'next page', and load the next page of entries, then Kodi has the previous page cached so if you hit 'back' it won't need to remake the list items again. It makes backing out of a list of pages quicker.
    - A bug in Kodi 18 means that the cacheToDisc of previous pages don't keep their watched status, meaning any watched media will all of a sudden not display the watched indicator when navigating back to them. Disabling 'cacheToDisc' will fix that, with the trade-off that backing out of pages of media will be slower.
    - This setting does not affect Furk It's caching of information, it just stops Kodi caching pages as you browse. 

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.25[/B][/COLOR]

- Added [B]bold[/B] to all Furk It context menu items when browsing movies and TV Shows/Seasons/Episodes to better distinguish them from the largely useless regular Kodi context menu items that can no longer be removed by add-ons.
- Changed Extended Info context menu item call to always use tmdb_id to assure accurate results.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.2.11[/B][/COLOR]

    - You can now download Easynews and External source results.

    - If FURK result is a PACK, both 'Download Archive' and 'Download File' is available. Choosing Archive will download the entire archive file into the Furk Downloads folder. Selecting File will download the appropriate single file from that PACK. i.e. If you scraped The Walking Dead S01E01, and you select 'Download File' for a PACK result, it will only download the S01E01 file from within the PACK into the 'TV Downloads' folder. Selecting 'Download Archive' will download the entire archive into the 'Furk Downloads' folder.

- Fixed no name showing when adding an uncached Furk file.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.98[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.87[/B][/COLOR]

- Removed Universal Scrapers Fallback Search option.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.83[/B][/COLOR]

Downloading info is cached for 1 hour, but is reset when you add a new file for Furk download, or open My Furk Active Downloads. It is designed to be a visual representation of what Furk is currently downloading for you, rather than necessarily a to the minute representation.
- Fixed number of files display for My Furk Files.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.82[/B][/COLOR]
- Added remove download from list (select file when in My Furk Active Downloads to delete the download).

- Preliminary support for Uncached Torrents added. (Uncached currently only available from media search results i.e. through Movie or TV Show menus, not directly through Furk Menus. This will change but I was short of time.)

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.79[/B][/COLOR]
- Added airdate format setting choice (Day-Month-Year, Year-Month_Day, Month-Day-Year). Thanks tknorris, wherever you are.
- POSSIBLY fixed Manage In Progress Shows.
- Fixed 'Include Airdate in Title' from Tools.
- PROBABLY fixed color issues with Next Episode.
- HOPEFULLY FINALLY Fixed Furk API issues on first use.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.78[/B][/COLOR]
- Fixed search history. (Moved history to database storage from settings storage. Still don't know why it stopped working.)
- Remade Next Episodes. (Could be buggy, but I hope not.)
- ABOUT NEXT EPISODES:
**It is made to work with either Trakt watched history or watched history coming directly from the add-on. Whichever source you have set up for your watched indicators (Trakt or Furk It), that is the source Next Episodes will use.
** Select 'Include Trakt Watchlist / Next Episode Unwatched' to include the first episode of every show you have in your watchlist.If you're not using Trakt, you can add unwatched shows to Next Episodes via the Add/Remove context menu item that appears for Movies and TV Shows.
** Settings for Next Episodes can be accessed through the normal settings, through Tools==>Manage Next Episode Options or through the Context Menu when inside Next Episodes. I always like to have quick ways of getting to relevant settings. These settings include a 'Manage In Progress Shows'. If you are using Trakt for your watched indicators, then this screen allows you to 'Hide' shows directly through the add-on, without having to go to the trakt site to do it. Shows in the 'Manage In Progress Shows' menu will have [EXCLUDED] in front of them if they are hidden in Trakt, and [INCLUDED] if they are not. Simply selecting a show will toggle it's hidden setting; click a hidden show to unhide it, click an unhidden show to hide it. You can also browse into the show through the context menu if you want to see what episodes you've watched etc. All these options are available if you do not have a Trakt account, Furk It keeps local databases of watched media and hidden statuses etc for people without a Trakt account.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.77[/B][/COLOR]
- Playback changes for proper subtitle support.
- Added multi-year search term for movies.
- Download changes to settings and notification behaviour.
- Settings menus options when navigating through add-on simplified as Kodi 18 does not navigate to a specific setting correctly.
- Reorder settings slightly.
- NOTE: Movie and TV Show search history broken. I have no idea why as Furk Video and Audio history still works and uses exactly the same function. I've given up for today and will fix it tomorrow!

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.1.76[/B][/COLOR]
- Trimmed Download settings titles, fixed Download folder icons.
- Added Notification options for Downloads (Every 10%, Constant, Off).

- Added half second delay when opening settings from within add-on (Might fix settings.xml reset problem).
- Change single Download folder to Movie Downloads, TV Show Downloads and Furk Downloads. Each needs to be assigned their own folder in settings.
- ABOUT DOWNLOADS: When getting results from the Movie or TV Show menus, you must navigate down to the final file within any package so as the file saves in the correct folder. i.e. You need the Context Menu to display 'Download File' and not 'Download Archive' so as to save in the correct Movie or TV Show folder. Any file downloaded from within the Furk menus (My Furk Files, Furk Searches etc) will save straight to the Furk Downloads folder, as will any Archive files (season packs or archives from Furk search results).
- Added Download Submenus for browsing new Download Folders.
- Added default tmdb api key. Please replace in settings if you have your own.
