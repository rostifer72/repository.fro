[B]Version 1.0.04[/B]
- Problem with scraper/s causing memory leak. I have quarantined 43 scrapers to try to fix this. Can't say for certain whether it has or not. As I have more time I will add scrapers back individually and test.
- Temporarily added other scraper modules to choose from in scraper settings. (eggscrapers, openscrapers, tempest, scrubs). I added these while testing to see if other add-on's scrapers had the same memory leak problem, which unfortunately they do. These extra source modules will be removed in an upcoming update.
- I'm keeping an eye on Openscrapers so when I think they are ready, I will switch Furk It over to using them instead of maintaining my own.
